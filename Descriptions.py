		# Weapons
		"the Glaive of Gore" : "This rustic glaive was forged during the first wars of men. Its intensely sharp blade and opposite flesh-hooks allow it to easily disembowel enemies with a single motion. Rivulets in the blade allow blood to flow from the blade down the shaft of the weapon in streams.",
			# 10% Chance to cause disemboweled effect, which causes a bleeding damage over time and weakens the afflicted.
		"Soulreaper" : "This ancient warscythe's blade glows a faint blue, indiscernible whispers are heard when wielding it. Its blade emerges from a skull on its shaft fashioned from femurs, which pulsate lightly...as if the weapon were breathing.",
			# Increasing damage with kill tiers, 6 tiers, at last tier also gains possessed brand.
		"the Singing Spear" : "This ornate spear can be heard emitting musical tones when moving, it was once wielded by Huehuecóyotl. Its broad head has eight bloodletting holes, and its sturdy wooden shaft is wrapped in faded yet colorful linen bands.",
			# Chance to change brand with every hit.
		"the Trident of Atlas" : "This legendary spear was used by King Atlas to forge the kingdom of Atlantis. Ornate images of sea monsters, heroes, and sea life adorn the full length of the trident, its three barbed prongs radiate with the untamed power of the seas.",
			# on strike, pushes non-hit enemies in a radius of 3 in the direction of the strike
		"Kraken" : "This ancient axe looks as if it had lain at the bottom of the ocean for centuries. Barnacles, coral, and in places even moss adorn this weapon like so many ornaments. Its simple design and light frame allow it to be thrown with relative ease and deadly effectiveness.",
			# This axe can be thrown but takes a turn to return, but deals secondary damage and immobilizes when ripped out of an enemy to return to user, assuming a hand is free.
		"Krog's Maw" : "This huge waraxe is the size of a mortal man, for it is said once to be wielded by the orc deity himself. Its single head is covered in huge teeth, spinning on mechanical chains to rend flesh. Records of those slain by this axe are depicted in crude markings along its ivory haft.",
			# Can gain an over-shield equal to a fifth of max health with this weapon when healing over max health with its vampiric brand.
		"Splinter" : "This deadly knife is coated in black adder venom that stops the heart of its victims in seconds. Its black single-edged blade blends into the grip without a hilt to separate, and its guard is wrapped by a thin, bone-white linen cloth.",
			# Applies 3 venom stacks instead of normal 2 on brand hit.
		"Swiftspike" : "This elegant dagger is constructed of elf glass and wyvern bone. This dagger is lighter in the hand than the empty hand itself, a strange visible force resides within the glass of its blade.",
			# Killing an enemy with this grants a burst of speed for a few turns.
		"Dawn" : "This ornate shortsword glows hot-red when sheathed and bursts into white-hot flame when drawn. Its short, double-edged blade is decorated with carvings of laurels and olive branches, and in its bronze pommel rests a brilliant diamond, which seems to burn brighter than the blade itself.",
			# Always applies flaming brand, and need more fire resistance to resist its fire brand.
		"Bloodreaver" : "This demon sword resembles a large falchion doused in blood. Its one sharp edge is jagged yet razor sharp, and blood seemingly flows through veins carved into the blade. In the center of its red hilt lies a large hole, in which floats a pulsating black amethyst. No one has dared to try removing it...",
			# Counters with this weapon apply a deathmark to the enemy.
		"Nightsbane" : "This bastard sword of legend has a name feared by all creatures of darkness. Its blade is forged entirely from blessed dark silver, its dark-golden hilt and guard in the form of a sharp cross. A vial of holy water rests in center of the hilt, and scrolls covered in holy words are wrapped around the weapon's grip.",
			# Automatically counter enemies who would be affected by silver brand.
		"Longfang" : "This beautiful bastard sword runs black and white with twisted vein patterns of damascus steel. The blade is inscribed with strange magical runes, one for each school of magic. The pommel is dominated by the ivory tooth of some creature, as long as the grip and as straight as a spike.",
			# Casting a spell while wielding this weapon grants this weapon the brand corresponding to the type of spell for a single hit.
		"Skullrazor" : "This bonesword has a name feared by all, its broad blade is so sharp it can shear bone on contact. Its hilt is made of compacted grey matter, no doubt accumulated over time from its many victims. It was once wielded by the Worldeater, who used it to slaughter entire civilizations in a span of weeks.",
			# Ignores all armor, all the time
		"God-Cleaver" : "This executioner greatsword has a name feared by all but the one who wields it. Once this blade tastes the blood of a victim four times, the fifth is guaranteed to end its life, regardless of magic and deception. Its blade is as long as a mortal man is tall, and its fully-engraved blade glows a faint orange.",
			# After 4 damaging hits with this weapon, the next hit will execute the target (if its not a unique?).
		"Worldshaper" : "This legendary hammer is the size of a mortal man, for it is said to have been wielded by Odin. A crackling blue energy field surrounds this golden hammer at all times. Its single golden head sits atop its long mithril shaft, and a brilliant opal rests on its large pommel.",
			# Killing enemies with this weapon restores a quarter tank of mana.
		"Mjölnir" : "This hammer of legend was once wielded by the god Thor, it still crackles with his thunderous energy. Its short haft is offset by its enormous, almost rectangular head, decorated with ancient runes and images of Yggdrasil.",
			# Electrified brand hit bounces thunder to adjacent enemies, harder to resist, and is more probable
		"the Gauntlets of Mars": "These ancient stone gauntlets generate a small energy field around them. The blood-red stone of the gauntlets are carved with ancient symbols of war and battle, and numerous cracks and battle-scars adorn the edges of the weapons.",
			# Blocking this weapon instead causes full damage and the blocker to be stunned.
		"the Talons of Belial": "These bone-white gauntlets hold in place two long, razor-sharp talons each. The talons are each longer than the gauntlet itself and curve near the end slightly in towards the gauntlet. Its a miracle if anything comes into contact with one of the talons and isn't shorn completely in half.",
			# Killing an enemy causes enemies of a lower tier in small radius to be feared for a few turns (feared also reduces ac slightly).
		"the Blasting Rod" : "This ghastly staff is made out of a silvered spine, as the shaft, and a skull for the head. It crackles with electrical energy, in the darkness the skull seems to grimace towards those who do not wield it.",
			# Hits cast thunderbolt on enemies hit
		"Tempest" : "This golden bow radiates with flashes of dark storms and bright sunbeams, for it was once wielded by Horus himself. It takes great strength to draw the string fully back, for the bow easily can retain its intended shape while strung indefinitely.",
			# Also fires quivered ammo at 2 other random enemies in range.
		"Godfinger" : "This seemingly normal bow somehow operates without a bowstring. When drawn, a blue phantasmal hand is seen over the user's own, assisting in the bow's operation. It is said that the bow has yet to miss a target, no matter the operator.",
			# You can never miss your target when firing this bow.

		# Shields
		"Baal's Generator" : "This mysterious shield consists of a light gauntlet attached to a glowing ethereal disc; it is said Baal has once wielded this shield . A purple orb of power shields the user when the gauntlet is raised, inside which whispering voices can be heard .",
			# Always blocks projectiles, chance to redirect back towards enemies
		"Invictus" : "This radiant shield is a round aegis of gold and bone. Your blood boils with victorious rage when you grasp its gauntlet, which design allows the shield to be used aggressively with horizontal bashes to the head.",
			# Acts as a weapon when attacking, 100% swing chance
		"the Black Cross" : "This massive obsidian shield was forged in the shape of a templar cross; holy symbols, seals, and vials of holy water adorn its front. When wielded, the shield has a palpable, burning hatred towards anyone or anything of magical properties.",
			# Applies burn effect to anyone that casts a spell in the same room as someone wielding it
		"Dominus" : "This bone-white shield was fashioned from the grimacing skulls of dozens of necromancers. Each skull is softly whispering in a different tongue, such that a cacophony of voices can be heard when surroundings are silent. Rumor has it that the skulls inhale flame, ice, and hellfire alike.",
			# Ignores enemy weapon brands completely

		# Armor
		"Kain's Pact" : "These fiery robes burn blood red to the eye. The robes utilize an ornate leather breastplate, resembling a rib-cage, to allow its users more protection than normal robes. Wearers are able to cast spells when magical energy is spent...for a price.",
			# Can cast spells with health when not enough mana.
		"the Phasic Robes" : "These ethereal robes seem to ebb and flow independent of the user's movements. The pinkish-orange robes feel as if they are made of heavy wool, but are as light as if from silk. Wearers are often seen appearing in multiple locations within the same time.",
			# Getting hit by a melee attack causes you to blink.
		"Plaguebringer" : "This feared chainmail armor uses inbuilt vents to spread infectious diseases through the air. The chainmail is rusty and almost green with packed filth, and spikes holding heads of various defeated opponents are adorned on its backplate.",
			# Emits an aura of plague, applying one stack of poison to enemies in radius 2.
		"God-Frame" : "This set of golden plate armor is designed to protect a god from anything possible. It is beautifully engraved with scenes of myth and legend, and on its backplate is welded a force generator that can emit bursts of stunning energy.",
			# Small chance to stun attackers on taking a hit.
		"Bloodshell" : "This dark red plate armor is covered in small white teeth, which seem to breathe and react to the touch. In place of a chest pauldron, this armor utilizes a cracked monstrous chronid skull, teeth flared outwards.",
			# Damage done by spikes also heals you for a percent.
